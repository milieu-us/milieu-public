## Intent 
Capture that agent capability (autonomy, count, orchestration) is only one dimension of system design. Milieu requires additional dimensions to safely and meaningfully operate agent systems.

---

## Summary

Current discourse on AI systems often focuses on increasing agent capability:
- more autonomy
- more agents
- more orchestration

This is useful, but incomplete.

High capability without supporting structure leads to instability.  
Structure without capability leads to stagnation.

Milieu explores systems that maintain both.

## Primary Dimensions (Working Set)

These dimensions are not yet formalized. They are observed and evolving.

### 1. Agency
What can act.
- human agents
- AI agents
- system agents
- degree of autonomy
- orchestration complexity

### 2. Governance
Who is allowed to act, and under what authority.
- role definition
- boundaries of action
- conflict resolution
- stewardship judgment and policy

### 3. Operations
How the system runs.
- environments (development, build, runtime)
- reproducibility
- deployment and control planes
- system agents executing work

### 4. Change
How the system evolves.
- change proposals (e.g., pull requests)
- review across agent types
- traceability of intent and outcome
- safe iteration

### 5. Validation
How outcomes are evaluated.
- technical correctness
- experiential quality
- feedback models
- learning loops

### 6. Memory
What persists over time.
- records (DR, ADR, REFERENCE, etc.)
- decision lineage
- auditability
- replay and what-if analysis

## Notes

- These dimensions are interdependent.
- Increasing capability (Agency) without strengthening other dimensions introduces risk.
- The appropriate balance is context-dependent and must be discovered through practice.

---

## Relationship to Existing Models

Some models describe increasing agent capability as a progression (e.g., from assistant → delegate → orchestrated agents).

This reference treats that progression as only one axis (Agency).

Milieu work explores additional dimensions required for systems composed of multiple agent types operating over time.

---

## Open Questions

- What is the minimum viable structure required for stability?
- Which dimensions must be explicit vs implicit?
- How do these dimensions map to records and operational artifacts?
- Where do failure modes emerge as capability increases?
